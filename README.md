# Weather-Simulator
level-up project written in c++ that simulates weather data over time and stores it for analyzing

 

## what it does
essentially simulates the temperature, humidity, and pressure of a full day (24 - hours).


## what did I learn
I mainly learned about keeping class in seperate files to keep the code clean. I had realized that if i use one file for every class and function for those classes then it would get messy real quick.
