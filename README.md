# Weather-Simulator
level-up project written in c++ that simulates weather data over time and stores it for analyzing

 

## what it does
essentially simulates the temperature, humidity, and pressure of a full day (24 - hours). Then, gives the average of those three types.


## what did I learn
i learned about keeping classes in seperate files, using csv files and how they are formatted. I also learned a bit more on how to use vectors by adding doubles in the vector together.

## what would I change
If I had to do anything, it would be to restructure the input received by the get_random_value function. In addition,  create more thorough names/comments and tidy up (make the code more understandable). Since I don't fully understand constructors, destructors, and fstream, I think it would be in my best interest to study at least a little bit more about each of those topics.
